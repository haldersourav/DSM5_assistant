       "'56\\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\\nsecond birthday (see also Rett syndrome in the section “Differential Diagnosis” for this\\ndisorder).\\nFirst symptoms of autism spectrum disorder frequently involve delayed language de-\\nvelopment, often accompanied by lack of social interest or unusual social interactions (e.g.,\\npulling individuals by the hand without any attempt to look at them), odd play patterns\\n(e.g., carrying toys around but never playing with them), and unusual communication\\npatterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to own name). Deafness may be\\nsuspected but is typically ruled out. During the second year, odd and repetitive behaviors\\nand the absence of typical play become more apparent. Since many typically developing\\nyoung children have strong preferences and enjoy repetition (e.g., eating the same foods,\\nwatching the same video multiple times), distinguishing restricted and repetitive behav-\\niors that are diagnostic of autism spectrum disorder can be difficult in preschoolers. The\\nclinical distinction is based on the type, frequency, and intensity of the behavior (e.g., a\\nchild who daily lines up objects for hours and is very distressed if any item is moved).\\nAutism spectrum disorder is not a degenerative disorder, and it is typical for learning\\nand compensation to continue throughout life.

       "'56\\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders\\nsecond birthday (see also Rett syndrome in the section “Differential Diagnosis” for this\\ndisorder).\\nFirst symptoms of autism spectrum disorder frequently involve delayed language de-\\nvelopment, often accompanied by lack of social interest or unusual social interactions (e.g.,\\npulling individuals by the hand without any attempt to look at them), odd play patterns\\n(e.g., carrying toys around but never playing with them), and unusual communication\\npatterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to own name). Deafness may be\\nsuspected but is typically ruled out. During the second year, odd and repetitive behaviors\\nand the absence of typical play become more apparent.
